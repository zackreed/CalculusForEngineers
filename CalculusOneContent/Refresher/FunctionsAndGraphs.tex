\section{Refresher: Functions, Graphs, Variables, and Amounts of Change}

This brief section is meant to jog your memory about some of the important ideas from algebra and precalculus that you will need to know in order to understand calculus. This is only a brief list of ideas and notation. If you want a more in-depth review, and are coming from ERAU, check out the EQUATES refresher MOOC [insert link to mooc]. If the refresher MOOC seems too difficult, or if you start to get overwhelmed by the fundamentals of algebra while starting calculus, you might want to talk to an advisor about what it would take to get you ready for calculus.
